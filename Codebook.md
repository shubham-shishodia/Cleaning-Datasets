# Codebook

The codebook contains a description of the various variables in the **final**, **tidy** dataset extracted from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone data available in the [UCI archives](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
The description of the variables is taken from the archive website and the "features_info" text file in the zipped data.
